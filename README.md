## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In order to use this extension, you will need to install, [opam, the
OCaml package manager](https://github.com/ocaml/opam), in order to
retrieve the LSP server.

If `opam` is not yet installed on your machine, please follow the
instructions on their website. Do not forget to invoke `opam init` first.

### Installation

In order to install the latest release of the VSCode extension and the
Catala LSP server, please refer to the [installation
instructions](https://book.catala-lang.org/1-1-1-linux-mac-wsl.html#getting-the-lsp-server-needed-by-the-vscode-extension)
in the Catala Book.

â€” and, optionally, you may also install the [code
formatter](https://book.catala-lang.org/1-1-1-linux-mac-wsl.html#getting-the-catala-code-formatter).

### Build from sources

> **_NOTE_**: You will also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the
> JavaScript package manager, to build the VSCode extension.

If you want to experiment with the latest version or build it directly
from the sources you may use these instructions:

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala-language-server.git
# 2. Enter the freshly created directory
cd catala-language-server/
# 3. Install the JS dependencies
npm install
# 4. Install the LSP dependencies
opam install . --deps-only
# 5. Build the extension
npm run compile
```

From this point on, you may test the extension by skipping to the next
section. Otherwise, you can package and install the extension in
VSCode by following these extra steps:

```bash
# 1. Install VSCode extension CLI tool: e.g.,
sudo npm install -g @vscode/vsce
# 2. Package the extension
vsce package
# 3. Install the generated .vsix extension through the VSCode GUI or
#    by invoking:
code --install-extension catala-XXXX.vsix
# Replace the XXXX with the current version
# 4. Install the LSP locally
opam install .
```

#### Testing

If you wish to test the extension without installing it, you may:

1. Open VSCode at the repository's root (e.g., in a terminal `$ code .`)
2. Go to "Run and Debug" in the VSCode sidebar (invoked by command
   "View: Show Run and Debug")
3. Choose "Launch Client" and click on the play button
4. A new VSCode window should open with the extension running
   - you can press `Ctrl+r` to reload the extension window to apply changes

### Using the Custom Test Case Editor

The custom (visual) test case editor usage is controlled by a configuration setting. To enable or disable the custom editor:

1. Open VSCode Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Catala"
3. Find the "Catala: Enable Custom Test Case Editor" setting
4. Check or uncheck the box to enable or disable the custom test case editor
5. Reload the VSCode window for the changes to take effect (you can do this by closing and reopening VSCode, or by running the "Developer: Reload Window" command from the Command Palette)

When the custom editor is disabled, test files will open in the default text editor.

Note: After changing the setting, you must reload the VSCode window for the changes to take effect. This is because the custom editor registration happens when the extension is activated, and changing the setting doesn't automatically re-register or unregister the editor.

### Developing

When developing on the "front" (typescript side) of the extension, you may invoke
`npm run watch` to continuously build the extension.

## Creating a New Release

1. **Update Version in package.json**:

   - Update the version number in `package.json`
   - Commit and push this change to the repository

2. **Create a GitHub Release**:

   - Go to the repository on GitHub and click on "Releases" in the right sidebar
   - Click "Draft a new release"
   - Create a new tag with the SAME version number as in package.json (e.g., `v0.23.0` or just `0.23.0`)

   - For pre-releases, check the "This is a pre-release" option
   - For stable releases, leave the pre-release option unchecked
   - Click "Publish release"

3. **Automated Process**:
   The CI/CD workflow automatically:

   - Verifies the release tag version matches package.json version
   - Builds and packages the extension
   - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
   - Attaches the VSIX file to the GitHub release

4. **Verification**:
   - Check GitHub Actions to monitor the workflow
   - Verify the extension appears in the VS Code Marketplace
   - Confirm the VSIX file is attached to the GitHub release
